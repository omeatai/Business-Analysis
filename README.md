- I would start understanding the new business domain by reading the existing "Business Process Documents" so that I can familiarize myself with the AS-IS business processes.
- I would also make sure that I understand all the "Business Jargons" associated with the project scope.
- I would also understand the current system in a "Sandbox DEV Environment".
- While I do this I would compile a list of questions that may arise and would elicit answers by talking to a designated mentor or SME (Subject Matter Expert).
