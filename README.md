- At this stage, the Business Requirements Document is created and represented as Functional Requirements Documents, Use Cases or User Stories.
- The Requirements Freeze Date - This is the last day of the analysis or making changes to the requirements when the stakeholders sign-off on the BRD.

- The developers write the code while the DBA start creating the database.
- If the developers have any technical question, they go to the System Architect.
- If the developers have any requirements related question, they go to the Business Analyst.

5. Testing -

- The QA ensures that the system is working according to the requirements documented by the BA.

6. Deployment -

- At the deployment stage, the IT Team ensures that when the deliverable is released, it's working fine and all the changes are live without any issues or errors.
